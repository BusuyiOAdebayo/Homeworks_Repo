â€“ I have an existing github account: for yourself on www.github.com//Eminentliz.

- I created my capstone repo (in a new folder) and named it Capstone-Repo.

    - I created a Project_Docs folder inside the Capstone_Repo folder.

    - Added an Image_and_Picture folder in the Project_Docs folder.

- Finally, I updated my README.md file -- using Markdown code -- to link to my new project documentation, and did a writeup of my Capstone project.
